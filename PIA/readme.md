 # Unit converter #

in the international system there are some units which have a representative value, as previously mentioned
this type of units and values applies to all countries. 

**how will it benefit me?**
as future engineers we will face several sutation in which we will have to have all the values in the same
unit, this is where this project called "unit converter" is born, besides representing an easier process we 
will be optimizin time in order to focus directly on the problem. 

 **Structure** 
**requierd data:** original unit and unit that i want.

**internal process:** the code will have the necessary formulas to perfomr the conversion that the user establishes.

**output:** the code will print the value you required along with the unit you desired.
